> p.s this calculator supports multiple equal presses that uses the previous operator and answer for the next equation.

### Inspiration
The design for the project was inspired by my dream mechanical keyboard [_Nuphy Air 96_](https://nuphy.com/cdn/shop/products/NuPhyAir96_Main01_221209_1800x1800.png?v=1683599578). I found the colors to be very soothing and aesthetic. I currently do not own this keyboard but hopefully in the near future I will.

## Things I wish I knew before starting
1. Create more functions to make `script.js` less repetitive and more succinct. I had to type in a lot of `eventListeners` which made my code very lengthy.
2. Use node list for taking data. Initially everytime the user presses a button, I would update a variable called `displayEquation` instead of just taking `calculatorDisplay.textContent` instead. Found this to be unnecessary and confusing, so I had to rewrite a big portion of the code.

## Final notes
I went into this project with prior knowledge of what The Odin Project curriculum covers. I initially wanted to watch a few YouTube videos to get an idea, but I ultimately decided against it as I felt like I would be spoon-fed. I only watched the videos _after_ finishing this project, and I believe there are many areas for improvement in my code.
